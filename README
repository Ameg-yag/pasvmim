A simple FTP file stealer I wrote in 2003. This program exploits the lack of randomness
in the opening of new ports in the context of passive FTP sessions, and the lack of authentication
on the DATA tcp stream.
Basically, what it does is to check if the ports on an FTP server are open sequentially and if so tries
to predict the new ports and steal the files.

I wonder if it still works on modern services. I do not claim it's good code, it's 10 years old !
For what it's worth,
